# Pageview Prediction
Developed at Deep Learning Hackathon hosted by The Home Depot in Spring of 2017

A neural network designed to predict pageviews given historical pageview data
Implements a RNN with LSTM cells to conduct supervised learning and predict the next day of pageview.
Several pre-processing steps are taken to normalize data and improve performance.
